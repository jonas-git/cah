    # cah - a simple website to play the Cards Against Humanity card game
The design of this site is intended to be structured, minimal and easy to use. There is no extensive use of libraries or frameworks to both prevent loading times to skyrocket and keep the complexity of the project low and essential. It's a project that doesn't serve much of a purpose besides learning some HTML and CSS tricks on the way and playing the game online with friends.

## Rules of the game
Cards Against Humanity is a card game that is about filling gaps in sentences with predefined building blocks to create the, in the player's opinion, funniest sentence possible. Everyone but one person, the Card Czar (referee), tries to achieve this goal and make the referee laugh. It's then up to the Czar who gets rewarded with having created the funniest sentence to his/her taste. The incomplete sentences and insertable components are written on and represented by black and white cards respectively and every player's choice of cards is handed to the Card Czar anonymously to prevent biased judging. The referee can optionally rotate every round such that everyone is involved in the game. At the and of the game, the player with the most awards wins.
