- create an admin control panel where you can do following things:
    * change any game settings
    * enable/disabled the game by starting/stopping the socket
    * ...
- have a sub-loading screen that doesn't cover the main header and toolbar
- encountered no response after adding SocketRequestTracker - have an eye on that
- have a utility that enumerates socket error messages (in German)
- log out on disconnect, and log back in on reconnect
    -> client still known by the server?
        -> continue anything that was going to on before disconnect
    -> client not known anymore (because of restart e.g.)?
        -> log back into lobby
- add informational text to the loading screen
- rename "intro" to "header"
- move DOM event listeners out of config socket event handler 'config'!
    -> it's going to be called again on reconnects
